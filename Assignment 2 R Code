#QUESTION 2#

#a) gender ratio
table(dt$gender) 
  #function is used to create a table representing the number of females and males 
  #the table is created to see how many male and females are employed at the beginning of the year to determine the gender ratio

library(dplyr)
group_by(dt, gender) %>% summarise(male = sum(gender == 1), female = sum(gender == 0))
  #group_by() is used to compute the summary by grouping the gender variable 0 and 1 as male or female
  #summarize() reduces multiple values down to a single summary so that I do not have to individually go through the gender data of all employees to determine the number of females and males
  #male = sum(gender==1) states that a data result of 0 is a male
  #female = sum(gender==0) states that a data result of 1 is a female
  #the overall function is used to determine the number of females and males in Chimera Corp to determine the gender ratio

hist(dt$gender) 
  #function is used to create a histogram of the employee's gender to visually express the number of female and male employees

#b) age range
table(dt$age) 
  #function is used to create a table representing the ages of all of the employees and the number of employees in that age group
  #the table is created to see the age range of employees at Chimera Corp

min(dt$age)
  #function is used to return the minimum of all the values present in the age column
  #used to determine the minimum age of the employees at Chimera Corp to determine the age range

max(dt$age)
  #function is used to return the maximum of all the values present in the age column
  #used to determine the maximum age of the employees at Chimera Corp to determine the age range 

summary(dt$age)
  #function is used to return the minimum and the maximum of all the values present in the age column
  #used to determine the minimum and maximum age of the employees at Chimera Corp to determine the age range
  #we will not consider the 1st Quantile, Median, Mean, and 3rd Quantile as they are not considered in determining the age range

#c) decadal age distribution
table(dt$age) 

group_by(dt, age>x) %>% summarise(lessthany = sum(age < y))

group_by(dt, age>0) %>% summarise(lessthan11 = sum(age < 11))
  #number of employees between the ages 1 and 10
group_by(dt, age>10) %>% summarise(lessthan21 = sum(age < 21))
  #number of employees between the ages 11 and 20
group_by(dt, age>20) %>% summarise(lessthan31 = sum(age < 31))
  #number of employees between the ages 21 and 30
group_by(dt, age>30) %>% summarise(lessthan41 = sum(age < 41))
  #number of employees between the ages 31 and 40
group_by(dt, age>40) %>% summarise(lessthan51 = sum(age < 51))
  #number of employees between the ages 41 and 50
group_by(dt, age>50) %>% summarise(lessthan61 = sum(age < 61))
  #number of employees between the ages 51 and 60

hist(dt$age)

#d) foreign nationals %
table(dt$local)

group_by(dt, local) %>% summarise(national = sum(local == 1), foreign = sum(local == 0))

hist(dt$local)

#e) number of cities
table(dt$city_size)

#QUESTION 3#

#gender ratio
group_by(dt,gender) %>% summarise(male = sum(gender == 1), female = sum(gender == 0), quit = sum(exit == 1), stay = sum(exit == 0))

#age range
group_by(dt,age) %>% summarise(quit = sum(exit == 1), stay = sum(exit == 0))

#QUESTION 4#

#a) distribution of employee job satisfaction 

#QUESTION 6#

#6a) % of core employees that left the firm
table(dt$core)

group_by(dt,core == 1) %>% summarise(quit = sum(exit == 1))

#6b) % of high-potential employees left the firm
table(dt$high_potential)

group_by(dt,high_potential == 1) %>% summarise(quit = sum(exit == 1))
